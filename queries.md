In a GraphQL query, a client specifies the data they want to retrieve from the API, and the API returns only that data in the response.

Here is an example of a simple GraphQL query:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

In this example, the query specifies that the client wants to retrieve the name and email fields for the user with the ID 123. The API would then return the requested data in the following format:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "johndoe@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

Another common use of GraphQL queries is to retrieve data from multiple resources in a single request. For example, the following query retrieves the user's name and email, as well as their recent posts:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
    posts(last: 10) {
      title
      body
    }
  }
}
```

The API would then return the requested data in the following format:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "johndoe@example.com",
      "posts": [
        {
          "title": "My first post",
          "body": "This is the body of my first post"
        },
        {
          "title": "My second post",
          "body": "This is the body of my second post"
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

These are just a few examples of how GraphQL queries can be used to request specific data from an API. The syntax and structure of GraphQL queries can vary depending on the specific implementation of the API, but the overall concept remains the same.

One way to use GraphQL is to define variables in your query. This allows you to reuse the same query with different values for the variables, making your code more modular and easier to maintain.

Here's an example of a GraphQL query with a defined variable:

```graphql
query GetUser($userId: ID!) {
  user(id: $userId) {
    name
    email
  }
}

```

In this query, the `$userId` variable is defined as an `ID!`, which means it is a required argument of type `ID`. This means that when this query is executed, a value must be provided for the $userId variable. The `user` field in the query uses this variable as its `id` argument, allowing the client to retrieve data for the specified user.

Here's an example of how this query could be executed with a specific value for the `$userId` variable:

```json
{
  "userId": "abc123"
}

```

This would retrieve data for the user with the ID of abc123.

Another way to use defined variables in GraphQL is to pass them as part of the query string in a URL. For example, the above query could be executed by making a GET request to the following URL:

```graphql
https://my-api.com/graphql?query=query+GetUser($userId:+ID!)+{%0A++user(id:+$userId)+{%0A++++name%0A++++email%0A++}%0A}&userId=abc123
```

In this case, the $userId variable is passed as a URL parameter, allowing the server to substitute the provided value for the variable in the query.
