### Lack of input validation

Lack of input validation vulnerabilities are a type of security vulnerability that can occur in GraphQL servers. These vulnerabilities occur when the server does not properly validate user input, potentially allowing attackers to send malicious data to the server. This can potentially result in a variety of security issues, such as injection attacks, access control vulnerabilities, and denial of service attacks.

Here is an example of a potential lack of input validation vulnerability in a GraphQL server:

```graphql
query {
  user(userId: "malicious-user-id' OR '1'='1") {
    name
    email
    password
  }
}
```

In this example, the attacker is attempting to exploit a potential injection vulnerability in the server by sending a malicious `userId` value. The `userId` value includes a SQL injection attack, which could potentially allow the attacker to access the password for the user, even if they are not authorized to do so.

Another example of a lack of input validation vulnerability in a GraphQL server might involve an attacker sending a query that includes a field that is normally only accessible to admin users. If the server does not properly validate user input, it could potentially allow the attacker to access this field, even if they are not an admin user themselves.
