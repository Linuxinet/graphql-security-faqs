### Injection attacks

Injection attacks are a type of security vulnerability that can occur in GraphQL servers. These attacks occur when an attacker is able to send malicious code to a GraphQL server via a GraphQL query. This can allow the attacker to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.

Here is an example of a potential injection attack in a GraphQL server:

```graphql
query {
  user(userId: "malicious-user-id") {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

In this example, the `userId` parameter in the `user` query is set to a malicious value that is designed to trick the server into returning sensitive data for a different user. If the server does not properly validate this input, it could potentially allow the attacker to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.

Another example of an injection attack in a GraphQL server might involve an attacker sending a query that includes a malicious if statement, such as the following:

```graphql
query {
  user(userId: "malicious-user-id") {
    name
    email
    if (user.admin) {
      password
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the attacker is attempting to include an if statement in the query that checks if the user is an admin. If the server does not properly validate this input, it could potentially allow the attacker to access the password for the admin user, even if the attacker is not an admin themselves.

To prevent injection attacks in a GraphQL server, it is important to properly validate user input and ensure that it does not include any potentially malicious code. This can include implementing input sanitization and other security measures to prevent attackers from sending malicious code to the server via a GraphQL query.
