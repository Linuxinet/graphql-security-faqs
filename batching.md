### Graphql Batching 

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need from a server. One way to optimize the performance of a GraphQL API is to use batching, which allows the server to group multiple individual requests into a single batch and then process them together. This can be especially useful when the client is making many requests that can be satisfied by the same underlying data.

To illustrate how batching works in GraphQL, let's imagine a simple API that exposes information about books and authors. A client might make the following two queries to get the title and author of a particular book:

```graphql
# Query 1
{
  book(id: 1) {
    title
  }
}
```

```graphql
# Query 2
{
  book(id: 1) {
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

These queries could be sent to the server individually, but with batching, they can be combined into a single request like this:

```graphql
# Batched Query
[
  {
    book(id: 1) {
      title
    }
  },
  {
    book(id: 1) {
      author {
        name
      }
    }
  }
]
```

This batch request is an array of individual queries, which allows the server to process them together. The server can then respond with a single response that includes the data for both queries, like this:

```json
# Batched Response
[
  {
    "book": {
      "title": "The Great Gatsby"
    }
  },
  {
    "book": {
      "author": {
        "name": "F. Scott Fitzgerald"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

Batching can also be used with mutations, which are requests that change data on the server. For example, a client might make the following two mutations to add a new book and a new author:

```graphql
# Mutation 1
mutation {
  addBook(title: "Moby-Dick", authorId: 2) {
    id
  }
}
```

```graphql
# Mutation 2
mutation {
  addAuthor(name: "Herman Melville") {
    id
  }
}
```

These mutations could be sent to the server individually, but with batching, they can be combined into a single request like this:

```graphql
# Batched Mutation
[
  mutation {
    addBook(title: "Moby-Dick", authorId: 2) {
      id
    }
  },
  mutation {
    addAuthor(name: "Herman Melville") {
      id
    }
  }
]
```

The server can then process the mutations together and return a single response that includes the data for both mutations:

```json
# Batched Response
[
  {
    "addBook": {
      "id": 3
    }
  },
  {
    "addAuthor": {
      "id": 2
    }
  }
]
```

Batching can improve the performance of a GraphQL API by reducing the number of round trips required between the client and the server. It can also make it easier for the server to cache data and optimize the handling of multiple requests.

### Batching attacks

For example, an attacker might attempt to use a batching attack to overwhelm the server with a large number of requests in order to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack. This can be done by defining the batch request with a minimum number of queries or mutations that will cause the server to crash or become unresponsive.

Here is an example of a batching attack that uses a minimum number of queries to cause a DoS attack:

```graphql
# Batching Attack
[
  {
    book(id: 1) {
      title
    }
  },
  {
    book(id: 2) {
      title
    }
  },
  // ...
  // A large number of additional queries
  // ...
]
```

In this example, the attacker is using a batch request to send a large number of queries to the server, with the goal of overwhelming it and causing a DoS attack. The server will have to process all of these queries, which could cause it to crash or become unresponsive.

A batching attack is a type of attack that exploits the ability of GraphQL to combine multiple individual requests into a single batch request. In the context of bruteforcing, an attacker could use a batching attack to quickly test a large number of combinations of username and password pairs, or one-time password (OTP) codes, in order to gain unauthorized access to an account.

For example, an attacker might make a batch request with a large number of queries or mutations that each test a different username and password pair, like this:

```graphql
# Batching Attack
[
  mutation {
    login(username: "user1", password: "pass1") {
      id
    }
  },
  mutation {
    login(username: "user1", password: "pass2") {
      id
    }
  },
  mutation {
    login(username: "user1", password: "pass3") {
      id
    }
  },
  // ...
  // A large number of additional login mutations
  // ...
]
```

In this example, the attacker is using a batch request to send a large number of login mutations to the server, with the goal of testing multiple username and password pairs in a short amount of time. The server will have to process all of these mutations, which could allow the attacker to quickly determine the correct username and password for an account.

here is an example of how batching works in GraphQL with defined variables:

```graphql
# Query
query GetBook($id: ID!) {
  book(id: $id) {
    title
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the `GetBook` query uses a defined variable `$id` to specify the ID of the book to be retrieved. This variable allows the client to specify the value of the ID when making the query, like this:

```json
# Query with Variables
{
  "id": 1
}
```

Without batching, the client would have to make a separate query for each book it wants to retrieve. But with batching, the client can specify multiple values for the $id variable and include them in a single batch request, like this:

```graphql
# Batched Query with Variables
[
  {
    "id": 1
    "query": "query GetBook($id: ID!) { book(id: $id) { title author { name } } }"
  },
  {
    "id": 2
    "query": "query GetBook($id: ID!) { book(id: $id) { title author { name } } }"
  },
  {
    "id": 3
    "query": "query GetBook($id: ID!) { book(id: $id) { title author { name } } }"
  }
]
```

This batch request includes multiple queries, each with a different value for the `$id` variable. The server can then process these queries together and return a single response with the data for all the books:

```json
# Batched Response
[
  {
    "book": {
      "title": "The Great Gatsby",
      "author": {
        "name": "F. Scott Fitzgerald"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "book": {
      "title": "Moby-Dick",
      "author": {
        "name": "Herman Melville"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "book": {
      "title": "Pride and Prejudice",
      "author": {
        "name": "Jane Austen"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

Batching with defined variables allows the client to make multiple requests with different parameter values in a single batch, which can improve the performance of the API by reducing the number of round trips between the client and the server. It can also make it easier for the server to cache data and optimize the handling of multiple requests.

To prevent such attacks, it is important for the server to implement measures to limit the number of queries or mutations that can be included in a single batch request. This can be done by defining a maximum number of queries or mutations that the server will accept in a single batch request, and rejecting any requests that exceed this limit.

For example, the server could implement a maximum limit of 100 queries or mutations per batch request, like this:

```js
# Batching Limit
const MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 100;

if (batchRequest.length > MAX_BATCH_SIZE) {
  throw new Error("Batch request exceeds maximum size limit");
}
```

With this limit in place, the attacker would not be able to test as many username and password pairs in a single batch request, which would make it more difficult to conduct a successful bruteforce attack. Of course, the specific limit that is chosen will depend on the requirements of the API and the capabilities of the server.
