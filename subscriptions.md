GraphQL subscriptions are a way to push real-time updates from a server to a client. They allow the client to specify a subscription query, and the server will push updates to the client whenever the data returned by the query changes.

Here's an example of a GraphQL subscription:

```graphql
subscription NewMessages {
  newMessage {
    id
    text
    sender
  }
}
```

In this subscription, the newMessage field is used to specify the data that the client is interested in receiving updates for. Whenever a new message is added to the server, the server will push the id, text, and sender fields for that message to the client.

To use subscriptions, the client must first establish a persistent connection with the server. This is typically done using a websocket. Once the connection is established, the client can send the subscription query to the server, and the server will start pushing updates to the client whenever the data returned by the query changes.

Here's an example of the type of data the client might receive from the server in response to the above subscription:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "newMessage": {
      "id": "abc123",
      "text": "Hello, world!",
      "sender": "John Doe"
    }
  }
}
```
In this example, the `newMessage` field in the response contains the data for the newly added message, including the `id`, `text`, and `sender` fields.

It's important to note that GraphQL subscriptions are only supported by GraphQL servers that implement the subscription feature. Not all GraphQL servers support subscriptions.

In GraphQL, subscriptions are defined using the subscription keyword, just like how queries and mutations are defined using the query and mutation keywords, respectively. Here's an example of a simple subscription that returns a real-time feed of comments on a particular post:

```graphql
subscription NewComments($postId: ID!) {
  newComment(postId: $postId) {
    id
    text
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the subscription is named `NewComments`, and it takes a variable `postId` of type `ID`. This variable is used to filter the comments that are pushed from the server to the client, so that only comments on the specified post are included in the feed. The subscription returns the `id`, ``text``, and author of each new comment.

To use this subscription, a client would first establish a web socket connection with the GraphQL server, and then send a subscription query with the postId variable set to the ID of the post they want to receive comments for. The server would then push any new comments that match the specified postId to the client over the web socket connection, in real-time.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
