**GraphQL** is a query language for APIs. It provides a common language for clients and servers to communicate, allowing clients to specify exactly the data they need from the server. Some of the key features of GraphQL are its type system and the ability to specify complex queries.

**Here are some common GraphQL keywords and their definitions:**

`type`: In GraphQL, a type is a way of defining a specific format for the data that can be returned by the server. For example, you could define a User type that includes fields such as id, name, and email.

`query`: A query is a request for data from the server. In a GraphQL query, the client specifies the fields they want to retrieve, and the server returns only those fields in the response.

`mutation`: A mutation is a way of modifying data on the server. In a GraphQL mutation, the client specifies the fields they want to change, along with the new values for those fields. The server then applies the changes and returns the updated data to the client.

`argument`: Arguments are additional pieces of information that can be passed along with a query or mutation to specify details about the data being requested or modified. For example, in a query for a user's profile, you might include an argument to specify the id of the user you want to retrieve.

`schema`: A schema is a way of defining the structure and capabilities of a GraphQL API. It includes the types that can be returned by the server, as well as the queries and mutations that clients can use to retrieve or modify data.

**Here are some examples of GraphQL keywords:**

**type**: In a GraphQL schema, a type keyword is used to define a specific format for the data that can be returned by the server. For example, you could define a User type that includes fields such as id, name, and email:

```graphql
type User {
  id: Int
  name: String
  email: String
}
```

**query**: A query keyword is used to define a request for data from the server. In a GraphQL schema, a query is defined with a type and a set of fields that can be retrieved. For example, you could define a user query that allows clients to retrieve a user's id, name, and email:

```graphql
type Query {
  user(id: Int): User
}
```

**mutation**: A mutation keyword is used to define a way of modifying data on the server. In a GraphQL schema, a mutation is defined with a type and a set of fields that can be changed. For example, you could define a updateUser mutation that allows clients to update a user's name and email:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  updateUser(id: Int, name: String, email: String): User
}
```

**argument**: An argument is used to pass additional information along with a query or mutation. In a GraphQL schema, arguments are defined as part of a query or mutation and have a type and a name. For example, in the user query above, the id argument is used to specify which user to retrieve:

```graphql
type Query {
  user(id: Int): User
}
```

**schema**: The schema keyword is used to define the overall structure and capabilities of a GraphQL API. In a GraphQL schema, the schema keyword is followed by the query and mutation types, which define the queries and mutations that can be used by clients:

```graphql
schema {
  query: Query
  mutation: Mutation
}
```

**resolver**: A resolver is a function that is used to fetch the data for a specific field in a GraphQL query. In a GraphQL schema, resolvers are defined as part of a type and are responsible for fetching the data for a specific field. For example, you could define a user resolver that fetches a user's data from a database:

```graphql
type User {
  id: Int
  name: String
  email: String
  resolver(userId: Int): User
}
```

Here's an example of a complete GraphQL schema that includes all of these keywords:

```graphql
type User {
  id: Int
  name: String
  email: String
}

type Query {
  user(id: Int): User
}

type Mutation {
  updateUser(id: Int, name: String, email: String): User
}

schema {
  query: Query
  mutation: Mutation
}
```

In this schema, the User type defines the fields that can be returned by the server, the Query and Mutation types define the queries and mutations that can be used by clients, and the schema defines the overall structure of the API
