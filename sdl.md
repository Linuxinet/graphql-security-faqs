GraphQL SDL (Schema Definition Language) is a way of defining a GraphQL schema using a human-readable and easily editable format. The SDL is written using the GraphQL schema language, which is a simple language that includes the basic building blocks of a GraphQL schema, such as types, fields, and arguments.

Here is an example of a GraphQL SDL schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  posts: [Post]
  post(id: ID!): Post
}

type Mutation {
  createPost(title: String!, body: String!): Post
}

type Subscription {
  newPost: Post
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  body: String!
  author: User
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}
```

In this schema, the `Query`, `Mutation`, and `Subscription` types define the entry points for queries, mutations, and subscriptions, respectively. These types have fields that specify the operations that can be performed on the API, such as `posts` and `post` for querying a list of posts or a single post, and `createPost` for creating a new post.

The `Post` and `User` types define the data that is returned by the API. Each type has fields that specify the data it exposes, such as the `id`, `title`, and `body` of a post, or the `id`, `name`, and `email` of a user. The exclamation mark (!) after the type name (e.g. `ID!`) indicates that the field is non-nullable, meaning it cannot be `null`.

To understand this schema, you can read it from top to bottom, starting with the `Query`, `Mutation`, and `Subscription` types, which define the entry points to the API. Then, you can look at the fields that each type exposes, which will give you an idea of the data and operations that are available in the API. Finally, you can look at the `Post` and `User` types to see the data that is returned by the API.

To use this schema, a client could send a query like this:

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    id
    title
    body
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

This query would return a list of posts, along with the id, title, body, and author for each post. The author field would include the id, name, and email of the user who wrote the post.

Alternatively, a client could send a mutation like this:

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(title: "Hello, world!", body: "This is my first post.") {
    id
    title
    body
  }
}
```

This mutation would create a new post with the specified title and body, and return the id, title, and body of the newly created post.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
