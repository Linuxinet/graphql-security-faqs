GraphQL is a query language for APIs that was developed by Facebook. It is often used to fetch data from a server to a client. Like any technology, there are potential vulnerabilities that can be associated with its use. Here are some potential vulnerabilities that can be associated with GraphQL:

**[Injection attacks](injections.md)**: These types of attacks occur when an attacker is able to send malicious code to a GraphQL server via a GraphQL query. This can allow the attacker to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions. For example, an attacker might send a GraphQL query that includes a malicious userId parameter that is designed to trick the server into returning sensitive data for a different user.

**[Denial of service (DoS) attacks](dos.md)**: DoS attacks are designed to prevent legitimate users from accessing a service. In the context of GraphQL, a DoS attack might involve sending a large number of complex or resource-intensive queries to a GraphQL server in an attempt to overwhelm it and prevent it from responding to legitimate requests.

**[Access control vulnerabilities](access-control.md)**: GraphQL servers can include access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. However, if these mechanisms are not properly implemented or configured, it could potentially allow attackers to bypass them and access sensitive data.

**[Lack of rate limiting](rate-limit.md)**: If a GraphQL server does not include rate limiting, it could potentially be vulnerable to attackers who try to overwhelm it with a large number of requests. This could lead to a DoS attack or allow attackers to access sensitive data by making many requests in a short period of time.

**[Poorly configured CORS headers](cors.md)**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers are used to control which websites can access the data on a GraphQL server. If these headers are not properly configured, it could potentially allow attackers to access sensitive data from the server.

**[Lack of input validation](input-validation.md)**: GraphQL servers can potentially be vulnerable to attackers if they do not validate user input properly. This can allow attackers to send malicious data to the server, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code or other security issues.

It is important to keep these potential vulnerabilities in mind when using GraphQL and to take appropriate steps to protect against them. This can include implementing security measures such as input validation, rate limiting, and access control mechanisms, as well as regularly testing and monitoring your GraphQL server for potential vulnerabilities.
